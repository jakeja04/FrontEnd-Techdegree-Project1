        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring software engineer who loves everything about computers and web design. I've lived in Charlotte for all 17 years of my life and have worked at my family business until recently,
          when I've decided to dedicate my time to become a self-taught Front End Web Developer.</p>
        <p>I’ve independently learned many skills throughout my short tenure of life, including three instruments, alongside graphic design. I am a fast, life-long learner who is always
        prepared to expand my skillset and am excited to add web development to that list.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My main goal at the moment is to become a job ready Front End Developer. I am currently completing the Team Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree, learning
        to make professional quality websites and web applications with:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a young, ambitious, and soon-to-be independently taught web developer, I'd like to work for a company that will help me continue to learn and grow within the field.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>As a recently graduated high school student, I have around a year and a half of work experience at my family's business. A few months before I graduated high school,
          I decided to focus full time on my studies as I wanted to be career-ready as soon as possible. I have taken introductory software engineering courses during my time
          in high school, and was very intrigued. A week I decided I was ready to make the big decision, and began my journey completing Team Treehouse's Front End Web
          Development Techdegree. I am very excited for what my future beholds in the tech industry and exhilirated to begin creating quality websites!
